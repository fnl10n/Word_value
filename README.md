# Word_value
Just want to know, is there are other words than 'Attitude' that sum is equal to 100.

## About this code
Write this script to practice my coding.

This script use English words from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt

## Note
This code assume that inserted text file is English words and have only 1 word in each line

So it split each line by '\n' and convert each alphabet to ASCII decimal integer then subtract by 96

Tested text file :
